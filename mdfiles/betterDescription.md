# Better Description

Here I simply list some of good expressions or sentences in top-level English papers. Keeping in mind that **practice makes perfect**.

- Then, we describe the state-of-the-art approach proposed by Sarkar et al., **henceforth referred to as** residual-based approach.

- In Figure 2, the **horizontal axis** represents the ..., whereas the **vertical axis** represents the ...

- As the configuration space often **explodes exponentially with** the number of configuration options, analyzing every individual system configuration becomes infeasible in real-world projects.

- The **t-wise** algorithm covers all combinations of any t configuration options. 

- When the cost of collecting data is higher than the cost of building a performance model, it's **imperative** to minimize the number of measurements required for model building.

- Learning curves typically have a **steep sloping portion** early in the curve followed by a **plateau** late in the curve.

- When the counts of features selected and deselected is, **at least**, at a predefined threshold.

- Our research questions **are geared towards finding** optional configurations when building an accurate model of a given system is not possible.

- The number of measurements is **an order of magnitude** smaller than XXX approach.

- Thus, any performance prediction model built for this purpose should be evaluated **not only** in terms of prediction accuracy, **but also** in terms of measurement cost involved in building the training and testing sets.

- This is a critical step that needs to be performed in every iteration and to check whether the built prediction model has **converged to** an acceptable accuracy.

- Projective sampling address this problem by **approximating the learning curve** using a minimal set of initial sample points.

- We search for a best-fit function that can **extrapolate** the remaining learning curve.

- The use of random sampling in those works **was motivated by the idea that** in practice, available measured configurations of a system might not follow any particular feature-coverage criteria and would be **essentially** random.
